# Clean-chroot builds

The optional backend builds against an independently provisioned Arch image using
bubblewrap's mount, PID, IPC, user, and (during offline builds) network namespaces.
Image paths, including /opt and /var, are mounted read-only. Runtime mounts
(/dev, /proc, /sys, /run, /tmp) are replaced; each run supplies its own writable
/build tree.
Source verification receives the host resolver as a read-only mount at the
image resolver's target, including systemd-resolved links into /run.
The regular Landlock/seccomp jail, source-verification separation, and resource
controls still apply.

Provision an image with Arch devtools, including the package's declared build and
runtime dependencies. For example, an administrator can run:

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed devtools bubblewrap
sudo mkarchroot /var/lib/pacvamp/chroot/root base-devel
```

Configure the client:

```toml
[policy.aur]
chroot = true
chroot_root = "/var/lib/pacvamp/chroot/root"
```

Then use the normal `pacvamp aur approve` and `pacvamp aur build` commands as a
non-root user. The host's installed libraries do not satisfy image dependencies.
Missing dependencies stop the build before any host package installation. Provision
repository dependencies or previously reviewed AUR dependency artifacts into the
image separately with devtools; pacvamp does not mutate this shared base image.
Update the image explicitly when you want a newer build environment.

Bubblewrap and working user namespaces are required. Startup errors are fatal;
there is no fallback to a host build. `doctor` checks the configured image and
bubblewrap executable; namespace startup is tested by the actual build. Receipts
identify the image and inventory its installed package versions.

The CI container uses privileged mode only to exercise nested namespaces. The
package recipe still runs as the non-root builder inside the read-only image.

## Managed environments

`sudo pacvamp build-env init /var/lib/pacvamp/chroot/root` provisions base-devel.
`pacvamp build-env update ROOT --destination NEW_ROOT` clones and upgrades a new
image; the previous image remains available. A failed provisioning command leaves
its destination for inspection, and never overwrites an existing image.

`pacvamp aur build PACKAGE --prepare-image` makes a disposable clone of the
configured image, installs missing repository dependencies there, builds, and
removes the clone. Pacman asks before installing unless `-y` is supplied.
Use repeated `--dependency-artifact FILE` for locally reviewed AUR dependency
artifacts with matching receipts. They are copied and hash-checked before image
installation. Remaining unsatisfied dependencies stop the build; this command
never approves or recursively builds an unreviewed AUR dependency.

This requires devtools, sudo/root permission for image provisioning, and enough
space for a copy when filesystem reflinks are unavailable. Dependency installation
can upgrade the disposable image to keep its repository packages coherent. The
resulting package inventory is recorded in the receipt. The shared base image and
host package database are unchanged. A forced kill may leave a temporary image
under the system temporary directory; its path is printed during provisioning.

Disposable images live under the user’s AUR cache in `.pacvamp-images`, independently of `TMPDIR`, so Arch’s default `/tmp` tmpfs does not absorb a multi-gigabyte image. Put the cache on the base image’s filesystem to allow reflinks; other filesystems require space for a full copy. Normal cleanup removes the clone; forced termination may leave a directory there for inspection and manual cleanup.

Before cloning the image or running the recipe, disposable builds authorize a dedicated cleanup process. It waits outside the build’s process group and removes the clone when the supervisor closes its pipe, so an expired sudo timestamp does not strand a successful long build’s image. Cleanup is anchored to the original private directory; replacing its pathname cannot redirect deletion. Provisioning failures before the cleaner starts can still require manual cleanup.

# Repository feeds

Version 1, draft. What a repository publishes beyond pacman's database so
pacvamp clients can verify more than a package signature. Every feed is a
JSON file with a detached minisign signature beside it
(`<name>.minisig`), signed with a distro trust key that clients hold
under `/etc/pacvamp/keys/*.pub` or `/usr/share/pacvamp/keys/*.pub`. The
key is separate from the package GPG key so the two rotate independently.

Feeds live next to the database: `<Server>/pacvamp-index.json`,
`<Server>/advisories.json`, `<Server>/verdicts.json`, where `<Server>` is
the repository's `Server` line in `pacman.conf`. pacman ignores them.

The JSON below illustrates field shapes; abbreviated digests and signatures are
placeholders, not deployable feed data. Configure trust through the
[operator guide](/adoption/opr) and inspect active policy with
[doctor](/protection-status).

## `pacvamp-index.json`

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "repo": "omarchy",
  "sequence": 1042,
  "generated_at": "2026-09-03T06:00:00Z",
  "db": { "file": "omarchy.db", "sha256": "..." },
  "packages": {
    "mise-bin-2026.9.1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst": {
      "sha256": "...",
      "size": 12345678,
      "published_at": "2026-09-02T18:00:00Z",
      "sidecars": [
        "mise-bin-2026.9.1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst.sig",
        "mise-bin-2026.9.1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst.provenance.json",
        "mise-bin-2026.9.1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst.vendor.json"
      ],
      "evidence": {
        "build_provenance": true,
        "vendor_manifest": true,
        "repackager_manifest": false,
        "vendor_attested_by": "vendor",
        "verdicts": 2,
        "reproducible": null
      }
    }
  },
  "build_keys": ["untrusted comment: ...\nRW..."],
  "repack_keys": ["untrusted comment: ...\nRW..."]
}
```

- `sequence` increases with every publish and never repeats. A client
  records the newest sequence it has seen and refuses a lower one, which
  catches a stale or rolled-back mirror.
- `db` is the pacman database this index describes; a client compares it
  with the file pacman downloaded.
- `packages` is keyed by file name. `published_at` is when the file was
  first served in this channel, which is what release-age floors use.
- `sidecars` are files next to the package that a client may fetch:
  pacman's `.sig`, the build provenance envelope (`.provenance.json`, see
  [provenance](/spec/provenance)), a reserved Sigstore sidecar (not currently a verified build-provenance path), the chained vendor
  packslip (`.vendor.json`), scan statements (`.scan.json`). Listing a file does not establish that the client verifies its format.
- `evidence` is what the repository claims; `build_provenance` is set
  only when the envelope verified with an accepted build key at index
  time. `vendor_manifest` means the `.vendor.json` sidecar holds a
  packslip the vendor signed; `repackager_manifest` means the repository
  signed one about the vendor's artifacts because the vendor publishes
  none (see [vendor pipeline](/spec/vendor-pipeline)), which is weaker evidence.
  `vendor_attested_by` repeats which. A client shows it and may verify the
  sidecars behind it.
- `build_keys` are the build hosts whose provenance statements the
  repository accepts. `repack_keys` are the keys the repository signs
  repackager packslips with; a client verifies such a sidecar against
  them.

## `advisories.json`

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "sequence": 17,
  "issued_at": "2026-09-03T06:00:00Z",
  "advisories": [
    {
      "id": "OPR-2026-0007",
      "pkgbase": "helix-bin",
      "commits": ["3f9c1a2b"],
      "versions": [],
      "tier": "aur",
      "action": "block",
      "reason": "maintainer account compromised; commit fetches a payload",
      "url": "https://pkgs.omarchy.org/advisories/OPR-2026-0007",
      "issued_at": "2026-09-03T05:40:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `commits` and `versions` narrow the advisory; empty means every commit
  or version of the pkgbase. Commit prefixes match.
- `block` means never install or build; `hold` means do not move to it
  automatically, a human may decide.
- Clients cache the feed and warn when it is stale interactively; with
  `trust.advisories = "required"` a stale or missing feed denies AUR
  operations unattended.

## `verdicts.json`

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "sequence": 3310,
  "issued_at": "2026-09-03T06:00:00Z",
  "verdicts": [
    {
      "subject": { "pkgbase": "helix-bin", "commit": "3f9c1a2b..." },
      "reviewer": { "kind": "static", "id": "pacvamp-policy", "version": "0.1.0" },
      "verdict": "flag",
      "summary": "install-script added; source host changed",
      "findings": ["install-script", "source-domain-changed"],
      "issued_at": "2026-09-03T05:30:00Z"
    },
    {
      "subject": { "sha256": "..." },
      "reviewer": { "kind": "av", "id": "clamav", "version": "1.4.2" },
      "verdict": "pass",
      "issued_at": "2026-09-03T05:31:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

- A subject is an AUR recipe at a commit, or a built package by digest.
- `reviewer.kind` is `static`, `av`, `ai`, `human`, `reproducible`, or a
  vendor's own kind. The client weights kinds through
  `trust.reviewers`; a `block` from a gating kind denies, a `flag` warns,
  a `pass` is silent.
- Because verdicts are keyed by pkgbase and commit, a repository can
  review popular AUR packages proactively and the feed doubles as an AUR
  review cache for `pacvamp aur review`.

## Producing the feeds

`pacvamp-repo index` writes the index; `pacvamp-repo verdict` and
`pacvamp-repo sync-aur --verdicts` append to the verdict feed;
`pacvamp-repo advisories add|remove` maintains the advisory feed. Every
feed update advances the sequence, updates its publication timestamp, and re-signs the file with
the feed key. See the [sync gate](/spec/sync-gate).

## Client behaviour

1. Load trust keys. With none, feeds cannot be verified and `trust.*`
   settings above `off` report that in `doctor`.
2. Fetch each feed and its signature; verify against a key whose id the
   signature names; parse; cache. When the network fails and a cached
   copy exists, use it and say so.
3. Enforce rollback protection on the index sequence against the ledger.
4. Use the index for `verify`, for `published_at` in release-age floors,
   and to show evidence in `info`; use advisories and verdicts as policy
   findings in `aur review` and `update`.

### Transaction enforcement

For OPR and custom-repository packages selected by `install`, `apply`, or
`update`, pacvamp applies the effective `[policy.trust]` settings before
pacman changes the installed package set:

- `index = "off"` skips index enforcement, `verify` validates an available
  index and warns when none can be obtained, and `required` refuses missing
  index evidence. A present but invalid signature, stale sequence, database
  digest, or package digest is always refused.
- `provenance` uses the same modes. When present, the provenance envelope is
  verified with a build key from the signed index and must name the selected
  package digest. `required` refuses a package without it.
- With `no_downgrade = true`, a package previously installed at a higher
  evidence level cannot move to a lower level or to unavailable evidence.

Pacvamp first has pacman cache the resolved transaction, then binds the exact
repository database and package filenames from pacman's plan to the signed
index. Accepted index sequences, package digests, build keys, and evidence
levels are written in the same atomic ledger patch as the completed package
transaction. Dry runs do not download packages or advance rollback state.
